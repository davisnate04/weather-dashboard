# weather-dashboard

## Description

This is a website for checking the weather in the city of your choice. Through this site, you will be able to input a city inside the search query. After inputting your city, it will display the current weather, temperature, wind speed, and humidity. There will also be a 5-day forecast, which displays the weather over the next 5 days. This site also saves your most recent search underneath the search query, so you will be able to just click on it to display that city again.
